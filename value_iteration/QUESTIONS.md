i. Analyze the programs (environment.py and value_iteration.py) and write/submit
a report. Also, capture two screenshots of the program execution and include
them in the report.

ii. In the program, the initial values of value function are zero. Change initial values
to random values. Observe the training process and include the results in the
report. Also, capture two screenshots of this modied program's execution and
include them in the report.

iii. With the original setting for value function, consider the following experiment.
Note that there are already triangles at (3,2) and (2,3). Now add one more
triangle with reward=-1 at (3,4). Observe the training process and include the
analysis in the report. Also, capture two screenshots of this modied program's
execution and include them in the report.
