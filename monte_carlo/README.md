This repository contains our code to answer the Machine Learning class Homework 4.
We will train agent to play **Grid World** by using the **Monte Carlo** algorithm.
Our code is a modification based on the code available from the
[RLCode Github](https://github.com/rlcode/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1-grid-world/3-monte-carlo)

## How to run

You can run the program by executing the following commands:

```shell
cd YOUR_DIR
python mc_agent.py i # to run scenario 1 (normal)
python mc_agent.py ii # to run scenario 2 (add one more triangle)
```
